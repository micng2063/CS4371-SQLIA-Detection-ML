# CS4371- SQL Injection Detection using Machine Learning
- Course: CS 4371 - Computer System Security | Instructor: Dr. Tao Hou, Associate Professor

# Abstract
SQL Injection is one of the oldest and most well-known attacks that targets databases on web applications. It is the most effective method for stealing data from backend databases, especially from relational databases by MySQL. With SQL Injection, the attacker can obtain and employ command statements to modify database schemes of sensitive and private information. [1]  Identifying potential SQL injection is essential to ensure the security and integrity of web applications and their corresponding data, which was made easier through the rapid growth of machine learning.

In this survey, we will conduct research on how machine learning has been employed to detect data associated with SQL injection and develop vulnerability predictors. As part of our survey, we also conducted a small-scale experiment where we trained simple machine learning models using the supervised learning method and its algorithms. The goal of this experiment is to train models to distinguish between a harmless SQL query and an actual malicious injection. Through this, we hope to gain a better understanding of how machine learning can be used to add an extra layer of security to computer systems against SQL injection.
